# Brief about 'How request get served by server to the client'

  - Client-Server is an architecture which describes the flow of request response between the client and server. It is the easiest way to define the flow of request and response and how it is been don through the network. Basically client-server interaction based upon various factors like network, protocols and platforms. This architecture contains the flow of response to the server , execution of request on the server side then revert back with the response to the client with better output.

  - To get the response from the server there are many things which plays a important role to deliver the request to client. When a client request a particular domain then there is request frame goes through the network and get acknowledged by the server to response the particular request. This depend upon the type of protocol used, it may be TDP or UDP.

  - Then after when request is delivered to the client, in the form of HTML it gets loaded on the browser and content shown. For a particular request client will request to login, register and many more features provided by the developer on the browser, called as UI. UI is the most important thing to design perfectly and correctly and to show available feature to the client or we can say to restrict something to access.
