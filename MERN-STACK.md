- # MERN STACK in Detail

  MERN STACK is a set of JavaScipt technologies which is used to develop a web application where we use 'MONGO DB' as database, REACT.js as a frontend and NODE.js for a backend process.

  In the following 'MERN' is stands for
    - M : MONGO DB
    - E : EXPRESS
    - R : REACT
    - N : NODE

  Where 'STACK' is stands for
    - Where collection of JS based technologies to build web based applications.

  __**MongoDB**__
    - It is an open source.
    - It is a document designed for ease of development and scaling.
    - It support embedded data models to reduce I/O activities on DB
    - It introduces the key concepts in MONGO DB, present the query language and operational reference section.
    - Itv contains document similar to JSON objects

              {
                groups : [ "news" , "sports"]
              }
    - Embedded documents and arrays in DB reduces the need of joins in the relations.
    - Features included :
        - High performance
        - Rich query language
        - High availability
        - Support for multiple storage engines

  __**EXPRESS**__
    - It is a most popular framework to deliver the request to the client from server side with different HTTP verbs at different URLs or route we can say.
    - It added additional request processing "middleware" at any point within the request pipeline.
    - It helps out to create compatible packages to address almost every web development problem.
    - There are libraries to work with like cookies, session, user login, URL parameters and many more
    - There is a 'Express Middleware" packages maintain in framework for reference.

__**REACT**__
  - React is a front end framework to develop web based application.
- It is also known as "React.js" or "ReactJS".
- It is JavaScript library for building interfaces.
- React is maintained by FACEBOOK and is COMMUNITY.
- React can be used as a base for development of single page and mobile development.
- React has a feature of "Virtual DOM" to work on.
- React component are typically written using JSX(JavaScript XML).
- React work on "Virtual DOM" structure that is it consume high memory on RAM. Thus it rely on the browser alternatives libraries to implement their components.

__**NODE**__
  - NODE is a back end framework to handle the request from client.
  - It is a runtime JavaScript environment.
  - it uses an event driven, NON blocking I/O models that makes it lightly and efficiently, NPM is a node.js package of open source library which is largest in the world.
  - It is an asynchronous event driven JS runtime, which is designed to built scalable network application.
  - It can handle many concurrent connection at a time.
  - When the connection request are made concurrently then for each connection a callback is fired. If there is no request then the thread is in sleep.
  - Node.js is mainly a connection handling mechanism which is a super efficient than our existing classical thread based model.
  - "Thread Based Networking" is relatively inefficient and very difficult to use.
  - Scalable system are very reasonable to develop in node because there is no directly I/O function will perform, so the process never blocks.
